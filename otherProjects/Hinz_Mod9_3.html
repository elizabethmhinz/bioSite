		<h2>Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
		<hr >
			<p>It was many and many a year ago,
   				In a kingdom by the sea,
				That a <span id = "maiden">_________</span> there lived whom you may know
   				By the name of Annabel Lee;
				And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   				Than to love and be loved by me. </p>

			<p>I was a child and she was a child,
   				In this kingdom by the sea,
				But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   				I and my Annabel Lee—
				With a love that the wingèd seraphs of <span id = "Heaven">_________</span>
   				Coveted her and me. </p>

			<p>And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea,
				A wind blew out of a cloud, <span id = "chilling">_________</span>
   				My beautiful Annabel Lee;
				So that her highborn kinsmen came
  				And bore her away from me,
				To shut her up in a sepulchre
   				In this kingdom by the sea. </p>

			<p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   				Went envying her and me—
				Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   				In this kingdom by the sea)
				That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   				Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. </p>

			<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   				Of those who were older than we—
   				Of many far wiser than we—
				And neither the angels in Heaven above
   				Nor the demons down under the sea
				Can ever dissever my <span id = "soul">_________</span> from the soul
   				Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </p>

			<p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   				Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
				And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   				Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
				And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   				Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   				In her sepulchre there by the sea—
   				In her tomb by the sounding sea. </p>
