		<h2>Chapter One: All About Liz</h2>
		<p> class ="intro" My name is Liz Hinz, and I was born and raised in Nebraska. Up until the summer
		of last year, I was still a resident until I decided to pack my bags and move to Arizona.
		I have a few cousins and an aunt and uncle here so it's been an easier adjustment. </p>
		<p>Currently, I am a full-time student and work full-time. This means, I spend most of my
		time either working or doing school work. It has been difficult at times, but I know it'll 
		be worth it when graduation comes.</p>
		<p>The few moments I have free time, I like to spend it doing many hobbies. <span class="sentence"> I love movies,
		especially horror. I also spend a lot of time golfing and playing on my Nintendo Switch. </span>I really enjoy experimenting 
		with different makeup looks, and find it is a fun way to express my creative side. </p>
		<p>Coding has become a more recent interest that I'm glad I pursued. It always feels so
		satisfying watching a piece of code work correctly. However, sometimes when things don't 
		work, it can be frustrating. </p>
